# This file contains global options for modelE.
# By default it assumes that the directory structure for modelE runs
# is set under /home/joe/data/giss-gc .

## Directory structure ##

# DECKS_REPOSITORY - a directory for permanenet storage of run info.
# All rundecks that you create will be copied to this directory.
DECKS_REPOSITORY=/__w/GISS-GC/GISS-GC/run/prod_decks

# CMRUNDIR - directory to which all run directories will be linked.
# This directory will be searched by most scripts for locations of
# specific runs.
CMRUNDIR=/__w/GISS-GC/GISS-GC/run/prod_runs

# GCMSEARCHPATH - directory to search for gcm input files.
# All necessary input files should be copied or linked to this directory.
GCMSEARCHPATH=/__w/GISS-GC/GISS-GC/run/prod_input_files

# EXECDIR - path to directory with modelE scripts and with some
# executables. This directory should contain the scripts from modelE/exec.
EXECDIR=/__w/GISS-GC/GISS-GC/run/exec

# SAVEDISK - a directory where all run directories (which will contain
# all output files such as rsf, acc etc.) will be created. This should
# be big enough to accomodate all model output.
SAVEDISK=/__w/GISS-GC/GISS-GC/run/huge_space

## External libraries ##

# Some of these options can be provided by environment modules (if you
# use them). Specify here only what is necessary. Options specified
# here will overwrite options proviided by environment modules.

# NETCDFHOME - path to location of netcdf installation directory.
NETCDFHOME=${NETCDF_F_HOME}

# MPI - set to YES if you want to compile the model for parallel
# execution on multiple CPU cores. Keep in mind, that functional
# MPI library should be installed on your computer and its type
# and location should be specified below.
# This option can be overwritten from the compile line.
MPI=YES

# MPIDISTR - the MPI distribution you are using. Currently supported
# distributions are: 'intel, 'openmpi', 'mpich2', 'mvapich2', 'SCALI',
# 'mpt'
MPIDISTR=openmpi

# MPIDIR - path to the MPI installation directory. (Needs to be set
# only if compiler can't find correct MPI library and include files by
# default)
# MPIDIR=/opt/openmpi
MPIDIR=${MPI_ROOT}

# MPILIBDIR - path to the location of MPI library. Set it only if
# it is different from the default $MPIDIR/lib
# MPILIBDIR=/opt/openmpi/lib

# MPIINCLUDEDIR - path to location of MPI include files. Set it only
# if it is different from the default $MPIDIR/include
# MPIINCLUDEDIR=/opt/openmpi/include

# ESMF5_DIR - path to the installation directory of ESMF (version 5)
# library. (Required only for Cubed Sphere simulations)
# ESMF5_DIR=

# ESMF_BOPT - optimization level of ESMF library. (Should only be used
# togeteher with ESMF5_DIR)
# ESMF_BOPT=O
ESMF=NO

## Architecture and compiler

# ABI - Application Binary Interfaces. This variable specifies the
# architecture you are using. The valid values are '64' and '32'.
# On most modern systems you should use '64'. Use '32' if your
# hardware or compiler support only 32-bit binaries.
ABI=64

# COMPILER - specifies the Fortran compiler you are using. Currently
# only 'intel' and 'gfortran' are supported. ('nag' has partial
# support on development branch.) If you are using Modules for
# Environment Management, then this variable may already be set in the
# environment. In this case you don't need to set it here.
COMPILER=gfortran

## General User Preferences ##

# MAILTO - email address of the user. When the program ends/crashes
# all notifications will be sent to this address. Leave empty
# or unset if you don't want to receive these emails
MAILTO=

# UMASK - the value of 'umask' you want to use for model runs. The files
# inside the run directory will have permissions set according to this
# mask.
UMASK=002

# OVERWRITE - can "gmake rundeck" overwrite files already in repository?
# (i.e. in the directory DECKS_REPOSITORY)
OVERWRITE=NO

# OUTPUT_TO_FILES - if set to YES all errors and warnings will be sent
# to files with the names <source_name>.ERR
OUTPUT_TO_FILES=NO

# VERBOSE_OUTPUT - if set to YES gmake will show compilation commands
# and some other information. Otherwise most of the output will be
# suppressed
VERBOSE_OUTPUT=YES
